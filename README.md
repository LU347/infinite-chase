## üéÆ About the Game  
**Infinite Chase** is my first attempt at building an infinite-runner game. I made this project for fun and as a way to dive into **Godot 4** and learn the ropes of game development. It's a simple game, but it taught me a lot about how games are structured and how object-oriented programming (OOP) principles can be applied in a real-world project.  

The goal is straightforward: dodge obstacles and survive as long as you can.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Development Journey  
I started this project with little experience in **Godot 4**, so I approached it as a learning exercise. Here are some highlights of my journey:  

- **Learning Godot 4**: I spent time understanding how scenes, nodes, and scripts work in Godot. It's such a powerful yet beginner-friendly engine, and I loved how everything felt modular.  
- **Implementing OOP**: I wanted to keep the code organized, so I focused on using object-oriented principles. For example:
  - Obstacles are separate, reusable classes.
  - The player character has its own script, with input handling and movement logic encapsulated neatly.  
- **Trial and Error**: A lot of this project was figuring things out as I went. Whether it was tweaking the movement speed, creating an infinite platform, or making sure the game felt "fun," it was all about experimenting and iterating.

## üöÄ What I Learned  
Working on **Infinite Chase** taught me:  
- **The basics of Godot's scripting language (GDScript)** and how it integrates with nodes and scenes.  
- **Object-oriented design**: Breaking down the game into modular pieces made debugging and extending the game much easier.  
- How small tweaks to game mechanics (like speed, obstacle spacing, etc.) can drastically impact how fun the game feels.
